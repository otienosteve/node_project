    "Facts":["born 27 November 1939", "It is claimed that he studied abroad (political philosophy in Paris, got a PhD in Tashkent, in Belgrade and at last in Dar es Salaam), but no proof has been found or provided.",
    "Kabila established himself as a supporter of hard-line Lumumbist Prosper Mwamba Ilunga. When the Lumumbists formed the Conseil National de Libération, he was sent to eastern Congo to help organize a revolution, in particular in the Kivu and North Katanga provinces.",
    "Assisted for a time in 1964 by guerrilla leader Che Guevara, Kabila helped Lumumba supporters lead a revolt that was eventually suppressed in 1965 by the Congolese army led by Mobutu, who seized power later that year; in 1971 Mobutu renamed the country Zaire",
"In the mid-1990s Kabila returned to Zaire and became leader of the newly formed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. As opposition to the dictatorial leadership of Mobutu grew, he rallied forces consisting mostly of Tutsi from eastern Zaire and marched west toward the capital city of Kinshasa, forcing Mobutu to flee the country.",
" On May 17, 1997, Kabila installed himself as head of state and reverted the country’s name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
"On January 16, 2001, Kabila was shot by a bodyguard at his presidential palace in Kinshasa."],

    "Facts":["Born 2 September 1924","into the Tugen sub-group of the Kalenjin people in the Kenyan Rift Valley, Moi studied as a boy at the Africa Inland Mission school before training as a teacher at the Tambach teachers training college, working in that profession until 1955."
    ,"He then entered politics and was elected a member of the Legislative Council for Rift Valley",
"Following independence in 1963 Kenyatta, who became Prime Minister and later President of the new nation, convinced Moi to merge the two parties. Kenyatta appointed Moi to his government in 1964 and then promoted him to vice-president in 1967",
,"Moi came to power in 1978, upon the death of President Jomo Kenyatta, having been vice-president until then",
"He succeeded in keeping Kenya relatively stable compared with many of its troubled neighbours at the time, working for regional peace. But he floundered badly on the economy, which regressed under his watch, and he failed to tackle deepening poverty and rampant corruption.",
"Kanu remained in place until 1991, when Moi caved in to international pressure to reintroduce multi-party politics."
